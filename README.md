### 🔄 **Structure Setup Steps**

1. **app.py** – This is the main Flask application script where routing and ML inference happens.
2. **model/** – Place your trained machine learning model here (e.g., `model.pkl`).
3. **templates/** – Store HTML files (e.g., `index.html`) for the web interface.
4. **static/** – Keep CSS, JavaScript, and image assets.
5. **requirements.txt** – Lists all Python dependencies needed to run the app.
6. **Dockerfile** – Defines the Docker image to build the containerized application.
7. **.env (optional)** – Use to store environment variables securely.
